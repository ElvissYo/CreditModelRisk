# CreditModelRisk
**Project Overview

This project builds an end-to-end machine learning solution for credit risk prediction. The dataset contains loan application information, and the objective is to classify loan outcomes into several risk categories.

The workflow includes:

Data understanding and cleaning

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Data preprocessing (encoding, scaling, handling missing values)

Handling class imbalance with SMOTE

Model training with Logistic Regression and Random Forest

Model evaluation with Classification Report, Confusion Matrix, and ROC-AUC
